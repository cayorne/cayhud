TF2 Hud, made by Cayorne
hey, thanks for downloading my hud, sorry it kinda sucks :/

to install go to /Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/ 
and then plop cayhud in the folder, if you dont have a /custom/ folder, just make one

if you're having trouble finding your tf folder, right click TF2 in your steam library
click "Properties"
in the top of the window that pops up click the "LOCAL FILES" tab
then click the button that says "BROWSE LOCAL FILES"
from there click the tf folder, and click/make a custom folder and put in the cayhud folder

if you have any ideas, just tweet me @cayorne on twitter, or add me on steam https://steamcommunity.com/id/toadspanker420/
